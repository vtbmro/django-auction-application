# COMMERCE 

This is the third project I built during CS50 Web, it was my first introduction to user authentification, models and migrations.

## Specifications 
* Allows users to create listings where they can specify a title, a description and a starting bid.
* The main page has a button called "Active listings" that redirects the user to page where all the active listing are shown.
* On each listing page all signed in users can bid, comment and add the listings to their watchlist.
* The owner of each listing can close the listing at any time making the highest bidder the winner of said auction.
* From the mainpage the user can also click the watchlist button where they can see all the listing they have watchlisted.
* There is also a page called categories where the users can explore listings based on the category the user has asgined them when creting them.
* Finally added all models to the Django Admin page.
